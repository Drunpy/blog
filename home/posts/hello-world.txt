# Hello

Express ideias in text is not a easy task but as the time passes I realize
it is a critical skill in Software Development/Engineering role. I've been
thinking in start a blog since the last year but it seemed to be too much 
work to create my own blog from bottom up, the first idea was a Django app
with a management system for posts or setup some external tool with a
custom DNS, one way or another my goal was to have the simplest blog as possible.

# Searching for existing tools 

At a first glance at the market I discovered interesting tools, like 
Substack¹, but but it look too serious and "Medium like". For my suprise,
turns out that "minimalistic blogs" are a thing and from what I found Hugo²
and Jekyll³ are ones which do the job well. Well... But design wasn't a problem
since I work in backend and my intention is to share knownledge via posts like this
initially.

# The realization

Fast foward, the other day I was doing some maintenace work in some legacy systems at my 
job and it required me to check Nginx docs constantly, after couple weeks I got to realize
that it was exaclty what I need for a minimal blog. I remembered to have seen something
about nginx's "autoindex" directive before, but I didn't got too far in it at that time.

# Result

After couple days trying to set it up properly... It's alive, this blogs runs
on nginx only, it has no backend application and no database. The setup is easy as you
only have to have a "Dockerfile" and a "nginx.conf", by the way, if want to have
a blog exactly like this, you can copy these files from the project's Github page:
https://github.com/Drunpy/blog


# Future

The plan is to keep developing new features but to keep it as minimal as possible.

- I'm planning to implement a RSS feed, because my bet is that more people will
reconsider RSS readers after the implosion of Twitter under Elon Musk command.

- Another thing is Analytics, Cloudfare Web Anlytics is holding it for now, but 
I'm amazed how hard is to find a analytics service that work with proxying requests.

- A simple chat or comment system where people can interact with the content/each
other wouldn't be a bad idea.

# The end

Thanks for reading until here, you can expect more content related to Computer Science
topics, backend development and others.
