Hello, I am Lorran!

I've been discovering software development since 2015 when I found
the book "Automating Boring Stuff With Python" from Al Sweigart and
started make some scripts here and there.

I started with simple automation using pure python, then jumped to
Web Scraping and ended up as a full time backend dev.

I work mostly with Python but I've done some Rust and Go.

I'm interested in topics like Computer Science, Statistics, Open Source
Software, Philosophy and Human Behavior.
